# SlugMod

## This plugin is now depricated now that DiscordInjections serves a build-in commands system.

You should place this file in the `Plugins` folder of the DiscordInjections project.

This requires JQuery and the `fuzzy` NPM module.

This plugin picks up after [CustomCommand](https://github.com/DiscordInjections/Plugins/tree/master/CustomCommand) and adds things such as a auto-complete modal and little popup messages.
